# CSE497-Data-Mining-
This repo contains the ipynb files of data mining tasks I performed during the CSE 497 course at Penn State

Clustering and Decision Tree:
This project contains the python notebook for analysing and classifying a data file using decision trees.
Various Statistics are first calculated and properties analysed, after which we perform classification.
We also perform feature selection and rerun the code for the same.


Hierarchal Clustering:
We perform various kinds of hierarchal clustering on the same dataset as before using the in built functions,
by first doing Principle Component analysis to reduce the number of features.

Hierarchal Clustering (Self):
In this python notebook, I have implemented my own hierarchal clustering algorithm using MIN method.
